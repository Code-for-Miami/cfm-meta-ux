# Code for Miami Meta UX
Let's use interaction design methods to improve the Code for Miami member experience.

## Why contribute?

* You want to practice your UX skills in a lower stakes, lower time-investment project
* You want to express feedback on your own experience as an attendee
* You want to brush up on some fundamentals (git/github workflow, user-centric design) before moving on to a "real" project
* You are a UX rockstar and want a good way to boost all Code for Miami efforts in one fatal swoop

## What are we doing?

We are using the methods of interaction design to research, model data, and document findings to improve the Code for Miami experience. We are essentially dog-fooding the approach and processes we use in designing projects to improve Miami.

## What is interaction design?

_interaction design_ is "concerned most significantly with satisfying the needs and desires of people who will interact with a product or service" (Alan Cooper). It is a skill that is typically used to design well-behaved digital interfaces. The principles of user-centric design are used throughout Code for Miami to design better solutions to important problems. 

## How is this project organized?

There are folders for each sort of thing (journey maps, personas, etc). Also a prototypes folder holds designs for possible solutions to meet identified needs.

## Child projects

Here are projects that address this issue
