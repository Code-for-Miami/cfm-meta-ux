# Civic Hacking 101

The goals of civic hacking 101 are to

1. Inform the community about civic hacking and the Code for Miami mission
2. Get prospective members interested in (and actually) contributing

Note: this is the naive first design based on casual observation and intuition

## Program

### Introductory Speech (5-10 minutes)

* Informs attendees on civic hacking (definition), and what the work of Code for Miami involves.
* should inspire, perhaps by communicating the urgent importance of our work.
* should give people energy (maybe with humor) since they might have just gotten off their day job. (Livio does an excellent job with this)
* should communicate benefits that are known to appeal to typical attendees.

### Attendee Introductions (1-2 minutes per person)

* We have everyone introduce themselves (Livio does an excellent job with this)
* gives us valuable information about what skills people have and their motivations (someone should collect this information)
* facilitates later networking

### Brainstorming activity (about 20 minutes)

* match people up roughly by interest, motivation and/or skills
* Should give attendees an opportunity to reflect on Miami and what sort of impact they would like to have.
* Should take general interest and energy and focus it on some problem.
* Maybe some just want practice with some technology, this is okay too

### Discovery & microcontribution (about 30 minutes)

* try to have them make a small contribution to a meta project of their problem (for example, literally cfm-meta-transportion if their interest is public transit) or start one if none exists
    * the meta project is a repo with links to all information, data, projects (perhaps storing some ideas, original and general research) to solve some problem in a user-centric way
    * some small contributions might be identifying stakeholders, getting the contact information of relevant public officials, linking to some resource
* maybe group people here instead

### Call to action (5 minutes)

* Now that most are interested and involved, encourage them to identify one small step they can take from the current meeting to the next one
* Action should be rewarded on the other side with recognition or maybe time to report the work done, however small
* give people direction to either network or continue working for the remainder of the time

## Additional notes

* There should be some food (maybe even just some light snacks) since many may not have had a chance to eat dinner yet
