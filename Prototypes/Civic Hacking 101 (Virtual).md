# Civic Hacking 101 (Virtual)

This is a naive virtual Civic Hacking 101 design in response to COVID-19

## Considerations

* Everyone is spending a lot more time at home with minimal social interaction
    * we should deliver more value and engagement than a TV show, movie, game, reading, or other at-home activities
* We want to incorporate civic user testing
* It needs to work virtually
* Needs to inform on existing projects at CFM
* Needs to expand on content with better quality sources (this requirement needs to be expanded on)

## Program Outline

### Introduce civic hacking as a concept

* Clarify what is meant by "civic hacking" (also importantly, what is NOT meant) from the start
    * Not about breaking security, think "lifehack" not "hack the mainframe"
    * Using expertise and creative problem solving to improve our community
    * Highlight a successful project as an example

### Touch on different ways to contribute

* Present ways to become elite civic hackers like us
    * Civic user testing ("*anyone* can be a tester, it's easy, takes very little time commitment, and makes a *big* impact")
    * Coding
        * everything is open source
    * Subject matter experts, community partners
    * If we are looking for any other sort of person, also highlight

### Brief and enticing introduction to current projects
    * Highlight what makes the project great and what they need help in
    * Go to Open Hack Night or lurk for more information

### Call to action, how to get involved

* Call to action, how to get involved
    * It takes less than 5 min to get involved
    * Join the Slack
    * Fill out the volunteer form

### Civic User Test

* Have someone volunteer to do a user test live so everyone can see what that's like
* This might make the meeting more interesting/engaging

## Technical considerations
* Microsoft teams has limited browser support, consider Zoom or Jitsi Meet as alternatives
* Projects need a uniform way to signal that they are ready for testing (and what outcomes they want to test for) and what sort of help they would benefit from (perhaps a "CONTRIBUTING" file in their github repo)
